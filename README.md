# Ghost-Toolbox
Run Ghost Toolbox on any operating system!

Download the necessary files.

Copy and paste "nhcolor.exe" into System32 (this exe is responsible for the colourful text as well as verification that you are running this on Ghost Spectre OS)

Now run Ghost Toolbox.cmd as Administrator.

There you have it!
